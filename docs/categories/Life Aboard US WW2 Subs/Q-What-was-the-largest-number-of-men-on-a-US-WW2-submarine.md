=== "Summary"
    Again, the Gato/Balao/Tench boats generally had 80 to 85 men aboard. For the normal crew size, the largest number was likely the Narwhal and Nautilus, which were large, slow submarines built in the late ‘20s. (These boats were about 35 feet longer, 6 feet wider and almost twice the displacement of the Gato/Balao/Tench boats.) They usually had crews of about 90 men.

For the normal crew size, the largest number was likely the Narwhal and Nautilus, which were large, slow submarines built in the late ‘20s.  (These boats were about 35 feet longer, 6 feet wider and almost twice the displacement of the Gato/Balao/Tench boats.)  They usually had crews of about 90 men.  That increased briefly to nearly 100 in the middle of the war and then returned to about 90.  These submarines had two six-inch guns and were often used for minelaying and transport of small units of guerillas and regular troops.

    However, there were cases when boats had extra passengers as the result of special operations, rescues or lifeguard duty.  A small sampling includes:
    USS Seawolf (SS-1977) was lost in1944 with 82 crew and 17 US Army personnel aboard.
    At one point, USS Narwhal (SS-167) picked up 32 evacuees, including eight women and two children.
    Overall, submarines rescued 504 downed aviators during the war with USS Tigrone (SS-419)-rescuing 31 in a single patrol to break the record of 22 by USS Tang (SS-306).  Some rescued airmen stood watches while on the boats.
    USS Gato (SS-212), in 1943, evacuated 27 children, nine mothers and three nuns from Bougainville.
    In September of 1944, USS Pampanito (SS-383) rescued 73 British and Australian soldiers in the South China Sea.  The rescued soldiers were aboard for about five days.  Sealion (SS-315) participated in the same rescue, picking up 52 soldiers.
    When the USS Darter (SS-227) ran aground on a coral reef in late 1944, her crew was rescued by the USS Dace (SS-247).  With two full crews aboard. there were likely about 160 sailors aboard the Dace for approximately one week.
    In February, 1942, the USS S-38 (SS-143) picked up 58  survivors from the British destroyer HMS Electra, sunk the day before at the Battle of the Java Sea.  This is particularly noteworthy because the normal crew size is only about 42 men.
