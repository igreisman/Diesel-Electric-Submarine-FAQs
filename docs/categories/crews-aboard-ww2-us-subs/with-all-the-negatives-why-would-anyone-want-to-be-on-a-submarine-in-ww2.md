# With all the negatives, why would anyone want to be on a submarine in WW2?


=== "Short Answer"
    Certainly, life on a diesel submarine can be primitive. The boats stink, they are cramped, they don’t ride on the ocean well and you may not get a full shower during the entire patrol. You may not see the sky for weeks at a time.

=== "Detailed Answer"
    Certainly, life on a diesel submarine can be primitive.  The boats stink, they are cramped, they don’t ride on the ocean well and you may not get a full shower during the entire patrol.  You may not see the sky for weeks at a time.  Even if you were a lookout, you still may not see the sun for weeks since the boats were often submerged during daylight while in the patrol area.  Diesel boats can be pretty unpleasant.

    Still, sub sailors did think it was good duty.  There were many advantages in being aboard a submarine.  Those advantages are different in peacetime than they were in WW2, but there were and still are many reasons to volunteer.

    During WW2, the main advantages appear to have been:

    In many cases, the biggest attraction was probably the extra submarine pay.  That appears to be about 50% added to the base pay for sub sailors, at least for the junior ranks.  This was very important to sailors when the country was just coming out of the Great Depression.  This extra pay would often be sent home and could be very helpful to their families.

    Submarines were the only ships that could take the fight back to the Japanese early in the war.  Even as the war progressed, it would take a while for the rest of the Navy to take the fight to Japanese waters.  There was a real desire to avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor, and service on submarines was the quickest way to start getting even.  There were the occasional attacks on the Japanese islands, such as the Doolittle/Halsey air raid on Tokyo.  However, submarines could provide a more sustained attack.

    This may seem a bit morbid, but some men thought that the worst thing that could happen to them was to come home maimed.  Submariners, on the other hand, were less likely to lose an arm or a leg.  The odds were greater that they wouldn’t come home at all, but they weren’t likely to come home maimed.  For some sailors, that was preferable.

    Some advantages still apply:

    The crews are better.  There were usually more volunteers for submarines than there were billets (positions) available.  Naturally, the submarine service took the best available.  Currently, reports are that you have to be in the top 15 to 20% of the Navy to be considered for submarines.  That is true even for non-nuclear positions such as storekeepers, yeomen (admin) and cooks.

    Submariners were – and are – an elite group.  It was a chance to be part of something special.

    The work is more interesting.  You often operate independently and without much direction from above or afar.  Sailors on our current submarines commonly cannot talk about much of what they did.  Even the old boats could be doing interesting work such as training with Navy SEALS or Recon Marines, or just practicing intelligence gathering and photo reconnaissance.

    You can learn something new nearly every day.  Sailing a submarine in three dimensions is more complex, challenging and interesting.

    Submarines are generally less formal than surface ships.

    Submarine duty could be a faster route for promotions.  For officers, it could be a faster route to commanding your own ship.  (This is no longer true since the advent of nuclear power.)
