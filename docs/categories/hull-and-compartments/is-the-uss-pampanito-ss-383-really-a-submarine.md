# Is the USS Pampanito (SS-383) really a submarine?


=== "Short Answer"
    That is actually a valid question. Modern submarines, even the non-nuclear boats of other navies, don’t look anything like the Pampanito from the outside. They are sleek black shapes and are mostly underwater. Only a little of the hull shows along with the upright sail. Unlike the Pampanito, they have no guns.
