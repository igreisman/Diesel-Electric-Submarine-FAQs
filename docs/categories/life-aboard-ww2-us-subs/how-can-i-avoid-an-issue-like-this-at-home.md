# How can I avoid an issue like this at home?


=== "Short Answer"
    We experience this most commonly when coming out of the bathroom at night. We turn off the lights and open the door, and we see nothing for 15 seconds or so. One solution would be to install red lights in the bathroom. However, that’s not likely to happen.

    Another option is to do the “pirate thing.”  (What on earth are we talking about here?  Is this person nuts?)  You have probably noticed that nearly all depictions of pirates include an eye patch.  Certainly, you didn’t think that every pirate has lost an eye to injury.  Pirates wear the eye patch when they are inside their lighted ship.  Then, when they go up on deck, they flip the eye patch out of the way.  Now they can see out of the eye that had been covered while the other is still adjusting to the dark.  We don’t need to use an eye patch.  Just close one eye about 15 seconds before we turn out the lights.  It looks strange for a bit, but it works.
