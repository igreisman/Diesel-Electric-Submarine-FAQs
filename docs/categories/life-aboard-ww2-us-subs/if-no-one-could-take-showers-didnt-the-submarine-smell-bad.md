# If no one could take showers, didn’t the submarine smell bad?


=== "Short Answer"
    Absolutely. Diesel submarines stank, especially when at sea. To clarify, it was true that most of the crew did not take showers. It would vary from boat to boat, but there just wasn’t enough fresh water for everyone to take showers regularly.

    Absolutely.  Diesel submarines stank, especially when at sea.

    To clarify, it was true that most of the crew did not take showers.  It would vary from boat to boat, but there just wasn’t enough fresh water for everyone to take showers regularly.  For obvious reasons, it was preferable that the cooks and the pharmacist mate (medic) be able to take showers, perhaps weekly.  The rest of the crew may have gotten a bucket of water occasionally from the air conditioning condensate.  They could use that to wash out skivvies and then take a sponge bath.  Humans contributed significantly to the smell.

    But human bodies were not the only source of odors on submarines.  There was the all-pervasive smell of diesel, other oils and engine exhaust gasses.  Paint smells linger too.  Paint might be the largest component of the odors on the Pampanito today.  Most of the crew smoked since cigarettes were given away free to servicemen in WW2.  (To be more accurate, most of the crew were active smokers and all the rest were second hand smokers.)  Yes, you could smoke in these confined spaces even when submerged.

    Finally, three of the four heads (toilets) drained to sanitary tanks.  The good news here is that these heads could usually be used when submerged.  The less good news is that when you drain something into the sanitary tanks, you need to vent an equal amount of air.  That would go through charcoal filters before venting back into the boat, but that only helped a little.

    Yes, diesel submarines smelled bad.
