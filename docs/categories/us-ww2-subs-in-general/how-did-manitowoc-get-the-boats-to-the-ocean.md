# How did Manitowoc get the boats to the ocean?


=== "Short Answer"
    Today, that would be straightforward. You would just sail the boats to the Atlantic Ocean using the St. Lawrence Seaway. However, that wasn’t completed until 1959. In 1941, the locks in the Erie Canal could not accommodate a ship longer than 300 feet and the locks on the St. Lawrence River were even shorter.

    Today, that would be straightforward.  You would just sail the boats to the Atlantic Ocean using the St. Lawrence Seaway.  However, that wasn’t completed until 1959.  In 1941, the locks in the Erie Canal could not accommodate a ship longer than 300 feet and the locks on the St. Lawrence River were even shorter.  These submarines were nearly 312 feetlong.  Therefore, the only water route available was through the Chicago Sanitary Canal to the Illinois River and then the Mississippi down to the Gulf of Mexico.  (Yes, the Chicago sewage canal.)  The submarines would be towed through Chicago to Lockport, IL, loaded onto a floating drydock (somewhat similar to a barge) and towed (pushed) down the rivers.  The Manitowoc shipyard needed to buy or build the drydocks.

    Chicago had built drawbridges which would have allowed the drydock to navigate the Sanitary Canal had the they all been finished.  The bridges were all functional for road traffic, but some of them didn’t open.  The shipyard needed to complete the rest of the mechanisms to raise the bridges.

    The completed submarines on the floating drydocks still would not fit under all the bridges on the Mississippi.  To solve that, the periscope shears, periscopes and radar masts were all removed before being loaded on the drydocks before Chicago and were reinstalled in New Orleans.

    One interesting story concerns a delay due to high water in spring on the Mississippi.  They had to wait several days for lower levels of water in the river in order to get under bridges.  There was no alternative other than to tie the tug and floating drydock up to trees and wait.  At times, submarine builders needed to be as resourceful as submariners.
