=== "Detailed Answer"
    The family-owned Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. was an experienced shipyard.  They had built many ships, such as ore carriers, that operated on the Great Lakes.  When the war broke out, they wanted to assist in the war effort and keep their staff employed.  Although they had no experience building submarines, and originally turned down the project, they worked with Electric Boat in New London to prepare.  They then built 28 submarines as a subsidiary of Electric Boat.  The sailors in Manitowoc boats really appreciated the high quality of the work.

    Manitowoc Shipbuilding faced multiple challenges:

    In order to understand how each piping or wiring system fit with the whole and the order of installation for each one, the shipyard first built a full-sized model of a submarine out of wood.

    They were building ocean-going submarines in a fresh water environment.  Fresh water weighs less than sea water meaning that it doesn’t support as much weight.  That, in effect, makes the completed submarine act as if it were tons heavier.  They had to compensate for that so the boat wouldn’t go straight to the bottom when it submerged the first time.

    Manitowoc submarines had to be launched sideways at commissioning due to the location on a river.  That had never been done with these boats.  There was concern that the sudden roll would damage some of the battery cells or that the boat would roll over.  The engineers decided to launch without the battery cells installed and calculated the expected roll of the boat.  The calculations were exactly correct and everything worked out well.

    Winter conditions on the Great Lakes are harsher than in Portsmouth, New London or Mare Island.  The submarines undergoing sea trials in winter collected quite a bit of ice when on the surface.  Much of that had to be removed before diving because of the added weight.  It made the boat top heavy and less stable.  This was also an issue, although to a lesser extent, in Portsmouth and New London.

    The boats then had to be sailed or transported to salt water.

    In spite of all the things the Manitowoc shipyard had to do just to be able to build these boats, they completed nearly all of them ahead of plan and under budget.  All but one of the boats were completed ahead of schedule, entitling the shipyard to performance bonuses.  They accepted some of the bonuses but not all, since they thought it improper to make too much profit during the war.

    The shipyard was also building landing craft and heavy cranes at the same time.  That construction did not interfere with building submarines or vice versa.
